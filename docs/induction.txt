Primary:
	Transistor: 2N6488
	DC voltage: 12V transformer
	Resistor: 6ohm 15W, 2A with power of 12W for alternate current
	Corcks and screws for metal (big side for a lot of coils)

Seondary:
	Corck and screw for metal
	Wire coils and a matching capacitor (how?) -> coltage probably has to be 5V but we can see
	Rectifier circuit for 5V (diode + capacitor)
