Create waterproof structure using molded piece. 3D printed case to hold the electronics. 1st option consists in envolving the case with hardned silicone with an acrylic base (the side mold can be done by 3D printing, but the PROBLEM here is that the silicone can stick to it). 2nd option consists in generating a silicone rubber mold arround the case, using 3D print walls and acrylic base for mold, and then turn it arround and close it with hardned silicone instead of having an acrylic base (the PROBLEM here is that silicone rubber is very liquid so the case might have to be pre-coated with waterproof paint). For the 2nd option vaseline will probably avoid the silicone mold to be stuck to the case or 3D printed walls and acrylic base mold.

Paint shops:
-coriprel (Baixa Xiado) - good if we know what material we want
-dyrup
-robbialac
-Luís Falcão, rua carlos oliveira, 1 (edifício amarelo) - good to get information of what we need
-mr dinís ???
-Amazon (all sort of materials are available online)

Mold / Waterproof materials:
Silicone material sounds expensive, but it is the best. Wax is probably very dirty.

Sensor requirements:
(1)comparison between two hands, and between people
(2)technique evaluation (times on each stroke zone, maximum velocity according to the made force) -> research require on swimming studies.
(3)velocity management (monitoring and real time feedback on swimmers performance - how to compute velocity?)

TODO:
-Develop software and singal processing that meets sensor requirements;
-Hardware: battery charging; probe resistance; removing observed bug (is this electrical contact issue?); isolation with access to USB.
    -switch and control battery level circuit
